        //Purposefully Systematic, 2020 [The recent emissions scandal were not an accident, and not a solitary incident. Rather it was one that mixed systematic deception with a history of carefully worded management. Using a diverse mix of inputs - from an interview with a self-driving car specialist and a song based on the core values of automobile manufacturers, to an historian who was commissioned to report Volkswagen's involvement in World War II and Achille Mbembe's writing on necropolitics - this film begins to mould a vision of the subtle ways that violence seeps in to every day environments.]
